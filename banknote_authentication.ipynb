        "In this project, we employ several supervised machine learning algorithms to build models that distinguish between genuine and counterfeit banknotes. We will analyze these algorithms to choose the best candidate, and then try to further optimize the algorithm to best model the data. Our goal with this implementation is to accurately predict whether a currency note is genuine or fake. This sort of analysis is needed, since every major economy is flooded with counterfeit notes. \n",

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. Wavelet Transformation tools were used to extract features from images. We investigate here with the original dataset, manually adding only the header line comprising of feature names, as it was not present in the original file."

Therefore, the modelâ€™s ability to recall all fake currency notes is more important than the modelâ€™s ability to make precise prediction.
